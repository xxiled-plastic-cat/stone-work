## Technical Considerations

### NativeWind Benefits for xUSD App

- **Consistent Styling**: Same utility classes work across iOS and Android

- **Responsive Design**: Built-in responsive utilities for different screen sizes
- **Theme System**: Easy dark/light mode implementation for better UX
- **Performance**: Compile-time CSS generation for optimal performance
- **Maintainability**: Utility-first approach reduces custom CSS complexity

### Development Tools

- **React Native CLI vs Expo**: Use React Native CLI for maximum flexibility
- **TypeScript**: Mandatory for type safety and better developer experience
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit or Zustand for wallet connection and balance state
- **Styling**: NativeWind for utility-first CSS styling (Tailwind CSS for React Native)
- **Single Screen**: No navigation library needed - simple conditional rendering

### Performance Targets

- App startup time: < 3 seconds
- Screen transition animations: 60fps
- Memory usage: < 100MB during normal operation
- Bundle size: < 50MB total

### Device Support

- iOS: 12.0 and above
- Android: API level 21 (Android 5.0) and above
- Screen sizes: iPhone SE to iPad Pro, Android phones to tablets

## Next Steps

1. Initialize the React Native project with TypeScript
2. Set up NativeWind and development environment
3. Create the basic project structure
4. Implement the design system and theme
5. Build the single screen with wallet connection states
6. Create the staking interface components
